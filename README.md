# Groseries-Landing-Page-with-Bootstrap-and-MailChimp

<h3>Function & Description:</h3>
This is a landing page a our groceries delivery start-up, Groseries. It is a simple one-pager featurette created with Bootstrap 4 that leads to a sign-up form powered by MailChimp. This allows the users sign up for updates and news. 

<h3>Challenge faced:</h3>
I could not center the text inside the p tag. The code I wanted to use to do so was:

```
<div class="row featurette">
        <div class="col-md-7">
          <p class="lead"><p>We help you do all your grocery shopping so you can focus on other more important things.
      <br> 

      <br>
      It costs $1 per hour!</p> 

      <buffer>

      <button class="btn btn-primary btn-s">Sign me up!</button>
      </section></p>
      </div>
```

<h3>Solution:</h3>
I saw a better way to do it on Stck Overflow with the following:

```
<div class="row featurette">
        <div class="col text-center">
          <p class="lead"><p>We help you do all your grocery shopping so you can focus on other more important things.
      <br> 
```
